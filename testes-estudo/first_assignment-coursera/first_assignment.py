# Part C: Consider the standard web log file in assets/logdata.txt. This file 
# records the access a user makes when visiting a web page (like this # one!). 
# Each line of the log has the following items:

# a host (e.g., '146.204.224.152')
# a user_name (e.g., 'feest6811' note: sometimes the user name is missing! In this 
# case, use '-' as the value for the username.)
# the time a request was made (e.g., '21/Jun/2019:15:45:24 -0700')
# the post request type (e.g., 'POST /incentivize HTTP/1.1' note: not everything is a POST!)
# Your task is to convert this into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary 
# looks like the following:

# example_dict = {"host":"146.204.224.152", 
#                 "user_name":"feest6811", 
#                 "time":"21/Jun/2019:15:45:24 -0700",
